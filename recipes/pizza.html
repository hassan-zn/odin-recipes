    <li>1 1/2 c. warm water (90 to 100°)</li>

    <li>1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 c. Homemade Pizza Sauce, divided</li>
    <li>3 c. shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 c. cubed fresh mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>Fresh basil, to serve</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Sprinkle the yeast and sugar over the warm water (90 to 100°) in the bowl of a stand mixer. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Drizzle the top of the dough and down the sides of the bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
    </li>
    <li>
        About 1 hour before you're ready to make pizza, place a pizza stone, steel, or an upside-down baking sheet on the upper third rack of the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
        On a lightly floured work surface, cut the dough in half and form into tight rounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place a 14-inch piece of heavy-duty foil on top of an upside-down half-sheet pan. 
    </li>
    <li>
        On a well-floured surface, press 1 piece of dough into an 8-inch round with a 1-inch outer lip.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sprinkle the surface of the pizza with 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan. Spread 1/2 cup Homemade Pizza Sauce over the parmesan, leaving a 1-inch border.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the upside-down baking sheet as a pizza peel, transfer the pizza with the foil to the preheated baking stone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the process with the remaining dough, sauce, and cheese. Do not assemble the pizza until right before it goes into the oven.
